Privacy Policy for AuroraNow

Last Updated: 22/02/2026

Welcome to AuroraNow. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

1. Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App includes:

a. Geolocation Information
To provide localized darkness, visibility, and cloud cover data, we may request access or permission to track location-based information from your mobile device. We only collect this data if you explicitly grant us permission or manually enter your coordinates.

b. Device and Usage Data
We automatically collect certain information when you use the App, including your device type, operating system, unique device identifiers (such as FCM tokens for push notifications), and interaction data.

c. Financial Data (In-App Purchases)
If you purchase an AuroraNow Pro subscription, your payment is processed directly by the App Store (Apple) or Google Play. We do not collect or store your actual credit card details. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription statuses, which securely links an anonymous User ID to your purchase history.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information collected to:

Provide, operate, and maintain the App.

Send you push notifications regarding Aurora activity based on your alert thresholds.

Deliver localized weather and visibility data (e.g., Cloud Cover).

Serve targeted advertisements to free-tier users.

Process and manage subscriptions.

3. Third-Party Services

We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf:

Supabase: Used for anonymous user authentication and database management (saving your alert preferences and push tokens).

RevenueCat: Used to manage auto-renewing subscriptions and unlock Pro features.

Google AdMob: Used to serve advertisements to non-Pro users. AdMob may use advertising IDs to serve personalized ads.

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): Used to securely deliver push notifications to your device.

Open-Meteo: Used to fetch real-time cloud cover data based on your location coordinates.

4. Advertising

For users on the free tier, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements. Ad networks may use unique device identifiers to provide personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device's settings (e.g., "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android, or "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS).

5. Your Data Rights (GDPR/UK GDPR)

Depending on your location, you may have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data. Because AuroraNow largely relies on anonymous UUIDs rather than personal identifiers (like names or emails), you can effectively delete your data by uninstalling the app and clearing its data from your device, which severs the connection to your anonymous profile.
