Terms of Use for AuroraNow

Last Updated: 22/02/2016

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the AuroraNow mobile application ("App"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

1. Use of the App

AuroraNow provides space weather data, aurora forecasts, and local viewing conditions. You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in a way that does not infringe the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use of the App.

2. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

a. Unpredictability of Nature
The Aurora Borealis / Australis is a natural phenomenon. While AuroraNow uses real-time solar wind data and advanced algorithms to provide accurate forecasts, we do not guarantee that you will see the aurora. Space weather changes rapidly, and local weather (clouds, light pollution) heavily impacts visibility.

b. Assumption of Risk
Aurora hunting often involves traveling at night, sometimes to remote or dark locations, and in cold weather. You are solely responsible for your own safety, travel decisions, and well-being. AuroraNow and its developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, injuries, or expenses incurred while using the App or attempting to view the aurora based on our alerts.

3. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases (AuroraNow Pro)

AuroraNow offers an optional premium subscription ("AuroraNow Pro") that unlocks advanced features, custom alert thresholds, and removes advertisements.

Billing: Payment will be charged to your Apple App Store or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase.

Auto-Renewal: Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Management & Cancellation: You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time by going to your App Store or Google Play Account Settings after purchase. Canceling a subscription stops future billing, but no refunds will be provided for the current active period.

4. Intellectual Property

All content, features, and functionality of the App (including but not limited to UI design, algorithms, and branding) are owned by the developer of AuroraNow and are protected by copyright and intellectual property laws.

5. Third-Party Data

The App relies on third-party APIs for data (e.g., NOAA/SWPC for space weather, Open-Meteo for local cloud cover). We are not responsible for outages, inaccuracies, or changes in these third-party services.

6. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
